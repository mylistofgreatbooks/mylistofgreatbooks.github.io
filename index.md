#Hacking with Swift review

[*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store) is a great introductory book for new and intermediate iOS programmers. The book will teach you Swift and iOS through a series of practical projects.

You can learn the language by reading the first chapter, *Introduction: Swift for Complete Beginners*, or you can learn on an as needed basis. Personally I preffer to dig deep, so I've skipped the *Introduction* and started with the first project, *Storm Viewer*. The idea was to follow the first project and refer to the *Introduction* chapter when I find some language feature that I don't understand from practice.

It took me about one month to go through the book. All you need is a Mac that supports *El Capitan* or *Sierra* and *Xcode 8*. My advice is to go through each project, write the code by hand, don't cheat by using the provided source code. The idea is that by actually writing the code you will exercise your memory and better understand the actual code. Also, test the code on a piece by piece basis, don't blindly copy the code. Implement a part of the project, say a class or a function and build the project. This will help you to find any typo early and will also teach you to write code. Every time you learn something new add a comment in the project for your own use later.

You can supplement *Hacking with Swift* by reading in parallel the free (more theoretical) Apple book *Swift Programming Language*. Apple's book, while well written, is not well switted to learn *Swift* and *iOS* from scratch.

When you don't understand something don't be affraid to ask for help on *Reddit*, specifically on the [*/r/swift*](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/) subreddit, the author, Paul Hudson, tends to answer same day.
