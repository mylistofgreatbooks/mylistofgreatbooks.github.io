#Hacking with Swift review

*Hacking with Swift* is a great introductory book for new and intermediate iOS programmers. The book will teach you Swift and iOS through a series of practical projects.

You can learn the language by reading the first chapter, *Introduction: Swift for Complete Beginners*, or you can learn on an as needed basis. Personally I preffer to dig deep, so I've skipped the *Introduction* and started with the first project, *Storm Viewer*. The idea was to follow the first project and refer to the *Introduction* chapter when I find some language feature that I don't understand from practice.
